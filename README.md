[Drone](https://drone.io/) plugin for [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm).

This project generates an entrypoint script for drone based upon `fpm -h` output to combine repeatable, simple, 
configuration as code from drone with the ease and versatility of package management from fpm.

My personal use case is that I want to be able to define Debian package creation in code for my projects one time, and
then copy and paste that to all future projects that require Debian packaging ðŸ‘Œ.

## Usage
This plugin supports all long hand fpm flags. All flag options can be used as plugin settings by substituting all `-`
with `_`. For example, the output type fpm option looks like this:
```bash
-t, --output-type OUTPUT_TYPE the type of package you want to create (deb, rpm, solaris, etc)
```
For this option, the shorthand `-t` is ignored, and the drone plugin accepts `output_type`.

For flags that do not have input (`--verbose` as an example), the drone plugin ignores the input given and simply passes
the flag to fpm, so any value would do (`verbose: true` as an example).

There is one special option for the drone plugin named `command_arguments` that is used for the positional arguments
required for the input type in use. For more clarity, you can see how this is used in the
[entrypoint template](assets/entrypoint.sh.templ).

For a complete list of options, see the [fpm documentation](https://fpm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Example
This example creates a Debian package with a systemd unit file for a binary named foo:

```yaml
- name: build debian package
  image: quay.io/lodge93/drone-fpm:latest
  settings:
    name: foo
    version: v0.0.1
    input_type: dir
    output_type: deb
    package: out/foo-v0.0.1.deb
    deb_systemd: foo.service
    command_arguments: out/foo=/usr/local/bin/
```

## Shell
This example shows how to run this plugin via `docker run`:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(PWD):/workdir -w /workdir -e PLUGIN_DEB_SYSTEMD=/workdir/test/generate-entrypoint.service -e PLUGIN_NAME=generate-entrypoint -e PLUGIN_VERSION=snapshot-$(git log -n 1 --pretty=format:"%H") -e PLUGIN_INPUT_TYPE=dir -e PLUGIN_OUTPUT_TYPE=deb -e PLUGIN_PACKAGE=/workdir/out/generate-entrypoint-snapshot-$(git log -n 1 --pretty=format:"%H").deb -e PLUGIN_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS=/workdir/out/generate-entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/ quay.io/lodge93/drone-fpm:$(git log -n 1 --pretty=format:"%H")
```

## Tests
To run unit tests, run the following:
```bash
make test
```

This project also packages the entrypoint generation binary as a very basic end to end test. To test this project end
to end, run the following:
```bash
make end-to-end-test
```
